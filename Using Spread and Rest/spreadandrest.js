/*
In this reading, you'll learn how to join arrays, objects using the rest operator. You will also discover how to use the spread operator to:

 Add new members to arrays without using the push() method,

Convert a string to an array and

Copy either an object or an array into a separate object 

Recall that the push() and pop() methods are used to add and remove items from the end of an array.
*/

//Using the spread operator, it's easy to concatenate arrays:
const fruits = ['apple', 'pear', 'plum']
const berries = ['blueberry', 'strawberry']
const fruitsAndBerries = [...fruits, ...berries] // concatenate
console.log(fruitsAndBerries); // outputs a single array

//It's also easy to join objects:  
const flying = { wings: 2 }
const car = { wheels: 4 }
const flyingCar = {...flying, ...car}
console.log(flyingCar); // {wings: 2, wheels: 4}

//Add new members to arrays without using the push() method

let veggies = ['onion', 'parsley'];
veggies = [...veggies, 'carrot', 'beetroot'];
console.log(veggies);

//Convert a string to an array using the spread operator

const greeting = "Hello";
const arrayOfChars = [...greeting];
console.log(arrayOfChars); // Â ['H', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o']

//Copy either an object or an array into a separate one

const car1 = {
    speed: 200,
    color: 'yellow'
}
const car2 = {...car1}

car1.speed = 201

console.log(car1.speed, car2.speed)

//You can copy an array into a completely separate array, also using the spread operator, like this:

const fruits1 = ['apples', 'pears']
const fruits2 = [...fruits]
fruits1.pop()
console.log(fruits1, "not", fruits2)
